# Statistical analysis of Crime data with R
This was the final project of my **Statistics for Data Science** class, in which we were assigned a demonstration of proficiency with both precepts of Statistical Analysis and R.

In this assignment, we were given a dataset of crime statistics for North Carolina in 1987, and told to recommend a crime policy position for an electoral campaign in that state.  The dataset was mostly real data, but had been altered by the instructors to provide some specific challenges to overcome.

My partner and I worked together extensively on all aspects of the report, but the parts that were more mine than his were the Exploratory Data Analysis, the review of CLM assumptions, the Omitted Variable Analysis and the Conclusion.

## Relevant aspects for this Application
- Proficiency in R Studio
- Data import, cleanup and wrangling
- Multivariate Linear Regression, models and interpretation
- Extensive validation of linear model assumptions, including analysis of direction and effect of omitted variables.

## R packages used
- Stargazer
- ggplot
- corrplot
- car
- tidyverse
